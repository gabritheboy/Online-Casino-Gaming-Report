## **Introduction**

`This project arises from the need for a precise monitoring tool for online casino performance, a necessity shared by many professionals in the industry. Often, bookmakers do not provide detailed control tools to final retailers, leaving an informational gap that can only be filled with personalized analyses.`

`The developed Excel dashboard allows for clear insights into gaming performance, identifying behavioral patterns and facilitating data-driven decision-making. The project is fully scalable and can be adapted to different levels of the gaming supply chain, from agents to regional managers overseeing multiple agencies.`
